Topics: Home Capabilities section redesign - three-column layout with parallax effects
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, restructured Capabilities section from 2-column to 3-column grid (image left, moving text center, accordion right). Added parallax scroll effects: left image zooms in only (scale 1 to 1.2) without translation using only scale transform, center text scrolls vertically (300px down) and fades (opacity 1 to 0.2) as it exits, right accordion list remains static. Implemented scroll-based transform calculations using `capabilitiesRef`, scroll progress detection, and state management for imageScale, textTransform, and textOpacity. Fixed text animation to use `translateY` instead of `translateX` for correct vertical movement. Reduced main heading font size from 48px to 36px. Updated parallax logic to trigger only when section is fully in viewport (section top < 0 && bottom > 0), with progress calculated as absolute top / height. Moved descriptive text below image outside animated wrapper so it remains static.
Decisions: Page-scoped parallax logic; 3 equal columns with 64px gaps; image and text move at different speeds based on scroll progress through section (minHeight 90vh, section padding 100px).
Next steps: Verify parallax smoothness and responsiveness across breakpoints; test accordion interactions with new layout.

Topics: Contact section text fill-back animation with floating 3D icons
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, replaced Contact section with new layout featuring large promotional text and floating 3D app icons (Photoshop, ChatGPT, monkey icon, S logo). Added text fill-back animation where text transitions from gray (#999) to black (#000) letter-by-letter across all rows based on scroll progress. Implemented scroll-based animation using `contactRef`, linear progress calculation (scrolled / scrollDistance where scrollDistance = viewport height + section height), and `textFillProgress` state. Created `renderAnimatedText()` helper function that combines all text lines into single string, calculates filledLetters count based on global progress, maps over textLines to render each letter with globalIndex calculation, and renders conditional `<br />` between lines. Icons positioned absolutely with perspective 3D transforms and semi-transparent styling. Letter-by-letter animation across all rows provides progressive reveal effect.
Decisions: Animation triggers when section is in viewport; text fills progressively from left to right, top to bottom as section scrolls through viewport; floating icons provide visual interest without distraction.
Next steps: Verify animation smoothness; adjust thresholds if needed; test responsiveness across breakpoints.

Bottom section includes social media icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) with hover effects, copyright text, and legal links. All styling done inline with hover states for interactive elements. Updated tagline to "Vulturelines" with smaller subtitle text. Changed navigation links from Spanish to English: "Our Service, Projects, Work, Our Team, Our Feed, Contact". Replaced Spanish contact info with Vulturelines contact details: Chennai address, +91 9791670504 phone, sutheesh.s@vulturelines.com email. Replaced SVG "H" logo with Vulturelines logo image. Changed background from purple-black to dark green and heading color from orange to black.
Decisions: Converted to static footer; dark green theme provides strong contrast; black heading provides emphasis; responsive grid layout for navigation sections.
Next steps: Test responsive behavior on mobile; verify all links work; adjust colors/spacing if needed.

Code changes: 
- Enhanced HTML meta tags in `index.html`: added viewport scaling, theme-color, Apple mobile web app tags, MS tile color, IE compatibility tag for better cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
- Added responsive styles for `.hero-content-bottom` across all breakpoints (768px, 576px, 420px) in `src/styles/main.css` - converts from absolute to relative positioning on mobile with proper padding and font scaling.
- Improved mobile hero layout: hero-three uses flexbox with order property on mobile (content-bottom order:1, sidebar order:2, actions order:3) to ensure proper stacking.
- Added cross-browser vendor prefixes: -webkit- and -ms- prefixes for flexbox, animations, transforms to support older browsers (Safari, IE11, Edge).
- Enhanced touch interactions: added -webkit-tap-highlight-color, touch-action: manipulation, min-height/width for touch targets (44px minimum) in mobile media queries.
- Prevented horizontal overflow: added overflow-x: hidden to html and body to prevent horizontal scrolling issues.
- Added hardware acceleration hints: backface-visibility: hidden, transform: translateZ(0), will-change properties for smoother animations across all browsers.
- Fixed text overflow: added overflow: hidden, text-overflow: ellipsis to project-name to prevent layout breaks on mobile.
- Enhanced animation compatibility: added -webkit-keyframes alongside standard @keyframes for slideRightToLeft animation.

Topics: Our Service rotating carousel - full structure view on mobile responsive
Code changes: 
- In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, added mobile detection using `isMobile` and `isSmallMobile` states with resize listener. Updated carousel to use responsive values: radius reduced to 220px on small mobile (≤480px), 280px on mobile (≤768px), 540px on desktop; perspective adjusted to 1500/1800/3500 respectively; container width set to 100vw on mobile, height set to auto; card sizes reduced progressively (small mobile: 160-240px width, 220-320px height; mobile: 200-280px width, 280-390px height; desktop: 280-410px width, 390-540px height); added responsive margin calculations.
- In `src/styles/main.css`, enhanced mobile-specific CSS rules for `.service-carousel-3d` class and carousel wrapper divs: added overflow: visible, full viewport width (100vw), margin: 0, left/right: 0 positioning; updated selector to target `div[style*="perspective"]` to catch dynamic perspective values; added `.our-service-page` class rules to ensure page container allows overflow on mobile (768px and 480px breakpoints).
Decisions: Progressive radius reduction (220px/280px/540px) ensures all cards visible across all mobile screen sizes; adjusted perspective and container dimensions provide full structure view without clipping; overflow visible on page and carousel containers ensures cards extending beyond viewport are shown; smaller card sizes on very small screens maintain visibility.
Next steps: Test on actual mobile devices; verify all cards remain visible during rotation across all screen sizes; verify horizontal scrolling doesn't occur unintentionally.

Topics: Our Service carousel cards - square shape on mobile responsive
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, updated carousel card dimensions to be square on mobile devices: height now matches width for both small mobile (≤480px) and mobile (≤768px) breakpoints. Changed height values from different clamp ranges to match width values: small mobile height changed from `clamp(220px, 48vw, 320px)` to `clamp(160px, 35vw, 240px)`; mobile height changed from `clamp(280px, 52vw, 390px)` to `clamp(200px, 38vw, 280px)`. Updated marginTop calculations to use same values as marginLeft for proper centering. Desktop cards remain rectangular with original proportions.
Decisions: Square cards on mobile provide better visual consistency and fit mobile screens more effectively; maintains aspect ratio that works well for touch interactions.
Next steps: Test carousel rotation with square cards on mobile; verify cards remain visible and properly centered during rotation.

Topics: Our Service header to carousel spacing - reduce gap on mobile responsive
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, reduced spacing between header section and carousel cards on mobile: changed paddingBottom of header div from `3em` to `1em` on mobile, and reduced tagline bottom margin from `2.5em` to `1em` on mobile. Desktop spacing remains unchanged (paddingBottom: `2em`, tagline margin: `0.4em 0 2.5em`).
Decisions: Decreased spacing creates tighter layout on mobile while maintaining adequate separation; reduces excessive white space between header and carousel for better visual flow.
Next steps: Verify spacing looks balanced on mobile devices; fine-tune if needed.

Topics: Mobile responsive - board of directors images show before animations process
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx`, added mobile detection state (`isMobile`) and section visibility tracking (`isSectionInView`). Updated board members slider to hide images initially on mobile (opacity: 0) and only show them when section is in view AND scroll progress > 0 (animation has started). Added smooth fade-in transition for opacity on mobile. In `src/styles/main.css`, set initial opacity to 0 for `.board-members-slider` on mobile breakpoints (≤768px and ≤480px) with transition properties for smooth fade-in.
Decisions: Images hidden initially on mobile to prevent showing before animations; fade-in only triggers when scroll animation begins processing; desktop behavior unchanged.
Next steps: Test on actual mobile devices; verify images fade in smoothly when scrolling to board section; adjust timing if needed.

Time: N/A
Topics: Board of directors section - first image stuck, then scroll image by image
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx`, modified scroll progress calculation to implement sticky first image behavior. Added `stickyThreshold` of 0.2 (20% of scroll) where first image stays centered (translateX = 0). After threshold, scroll progress maps to card indices (0 to totalCards-1) for image-by-image scrolling. Added `sliderRef` and `cardWidth` state to measure actual card width dynamically (including gap). Changed transform from percentage-based to pixel-based translation (`translateX(-${scrollProgress * cardWidth}px)`) for precise image-by-image scrolling. Card width measurement happens on mount, resize, and first scroll to ensure accuracy across breakpoints.
Decisions: First image remains stuck/centered when section first enters viewport; after 20% scroll threshold, images scroll one by one progressively; pixel-based translation ensures accurate positioning; dynamic card width measurement adapts to screen size changes.
Next steps: Test on different screen sizes; verify first image stays centered initially; confirm smooth image-by-image progression after threshold.

Topics: Excellence section - text quietly increases size on scroll
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, added `excellenceRef` and `excellenceScrollProgress` state to track scroll progress through excellence section. Added scroll listener that calculates progress from 0 to 1 as section moves through viewport. Applied scroll-based size increase to subtitle (15% max increase), description (12% max increase), and buttons (8% scale increase) using inline styles with smooth transitions. Size increases gradually and quietly as user scrolls through the section.
Decisions: Subtle, gradual size increase creates quiet growth effect; different increase percentages for different elements (subtitle 15%, description 12%, buttons 8%) for visual hierarchy; smooth transitions ensure non-jarring animation.
Next steps: Test scroll behavior; verify size increases feel natural and not too aggressive; adjust percentages if needed.

Code changes: In `src/styles/main.css`, added mobile-specific styles to center circular texts and numbers in the excellence section. For mobile breakpoints (≤768px, ≤576px, ≤480px): removed `translateX(40px)` offset from `.emblem-number` and `.emblem-text` using `transform: translateX(0) !important`; centered `.circular-text-svg` by setting `left: 0` and `top: 0` (removed 40px offset); added `margin: 0 auto` to `.circular-emblem` for horizontal centering; created new mobile-specific animations `numberAppearMobile` and `textAppearMobile` that use `translateX(0)` instead of `translateX(40px)`; updated `transform-origin` for `.rotating-group` to `50% 50%` on mobile for proper rotation center.
Decisions: Mobile-specific overrides ensure centered alignment on mobile devices while preserving desktop layout with 40px offset; separate mobile animations maintain smooth appearance without affecting desktop behavior.
Next steps: Test on actual mobile devices; verify circular text rotation and number/text centering; adjust if needed.

Topics: Hero page image slide animation improvements - slower speed and image preloading
Code changes: 
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Increased hero slide animation duration from 1.1s to 1.8s, then further increased to 2.5s for smoother, clearer transitions. Enhanced `heroSlideIn` keyframes to include fade-in effect (opacity 0 → 0.3 at 20% → 1 at 100%). Enhanced `heroSlideOut` keyframes to include fade-out effect (opacity 1 → 0.5 at 80% → 0 at 100%). Added smooth opacity transition to `.hero-bg-layer` for better image rendering.
- In `src/components/HeroThree.jsx`: Added image preloading functionality using `useEffect` hook that loads all project images before animations start to prevent broken images during transitions. Added `imagesLoaded` state to track which images have successfully loaded. Updated transition timeout from 1800ms to 2500ms to match new animation duration. Increased auto-rotate interval from 5000ms to 6500ms to provide better timing with slower animation. Added conditional opacity handling to hide images only if they fail to load.
Decisions: Slower animation (2.5s) provides clearer, more visible and relaxed transitions. Image preloading prevents broken image display during animations. Fade effects make transitions smoother and more professional. Auto-rotate timing adjusted to match slower animation speed for better user experience.
Next steps: Test hero section animation smoothness across different network conditions; verify images load properly on first visit; confirm animation speed feels appropriate.

Topics: Circle transition animation mobile responsive fix - full color fill animation not working properly on mobile
Code changes:
- In `src/components/CircleTransition.jsx`: Enhanced circle size calculation to use viewport diagonal with 2x multiplier (increased from 1.5x) to ensure full screen coverage on all mobile devices. Added minimum circle size of 2000px to guarantee coverage. Improved viewport calculation to handle edge cases with fallbacks. Added orientation change listener for mobile devices. Updated circle size recalculation on each navigation event. Increased reset delay from 1000ms to 1200ms for better mobile compatibility. Added transform origin properties with vendor prefixes for cross-browser support. Changed container to use dynamic viewport units (100dvw/100dvh) for proper mobile rendering.
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Added comprehensive mobile-specific CSS rules for `.circle-transition` and `.circle-transition-inner` classes. Added fixed positioning with !important flags to ensure proper layering. Added mobile breakpoints (≤768px and ≤480px) with specific viewport handling using dvw/dvh units. Added hardware acceleration hints (backface-visibility, transform: translateZ(0)) for smoother animations on mobile. Added min-width/min-height constraints for small screens.
- In `src/utils/navigation.js`: Enhanced touch event handling to support both mouse and touch events. Added support for `touches` and `changedTouches` arrays for proper mobile touch position detection. Added fallback position calculation using viewport dimensions when touch position is unavailable.
Decisions: Circle transition now properly covers full screen on mobile devices by calculating size based on viewport diagonal. Dynamic viewport units (dvw/dvh) ensure proper rendering on mobile browsers that adjust viewport on scroll. Touch event handling ensures circle animation starts from correct touch position on mobile devices. Increased circle size multiplier and minimum size guarantee full coverage even on large mobile devices in landscape mode.
Next steps: Test navigation from mininavbar and header menu on actual mobile devices; verify circle animation fully covers screen during transition; test on various mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android); verify animation works correctly in both portrait and landscape orientations.

Topics: Hamburger icon display only in hero header section for all pages
Code changes:
- In `src/components/Header.jsx`: Added `isHeroInView` state to track when hero section is visible. Implemented scroll-based detection that checks if hero section is in viewport based on current page route. Added `useLocation` hook to detect route changes. For Home page, detects `.hero-three`; for Work/Project Detail pages, detects `.project-hero` or `.work-hero`; for Our Team page, detects `.team-hero`; for Contact, Our Service, and Our Feed pages, uses scroll position (shows hamburger when scrollY < 30% of viewport height). Hero section is considered in view when bottom > 20% of viewport and top < 80% of viewport. Added scroll and resize event listeners with passive flag for performance. Added timeout delays (100ms and 300ms) to ensure DOM is ready after route changes. Applied `hero-in-view` or `hero-out-of-view` classes to hamburger button based on hero visibility state.
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Added `.nav-circle-btn.hero-out-of-view` class to hide hamburger icon (opacity: 0, visibility: hidden, pointer-events: none) with smooth transition when hero section is out of view. Added `.nav-circle-btn.hero-in-view` class to show hamburger icon (opacity: 1, visibility: visible, pointer-events: auto) when hero section is in view. Ensured overlay open state takes priority over hero visibility by adding specific rules for `.nav-overlay-open ~ .nav-actions .nav-circle-btn` with both hero classes. Added mobile-specific rules (max-width: 991px) to ensure hero visibility classes work on mobile devices.
Decisions: Hamburger icon now only displays when user is viewing the hero header section, providing cleaner UI when scrolled past hero. Different detection strategies for different page types: specific hero section detection for pages with dedicated hero sections (Home, Our Team, Project Detail), scroll position-based detection for pages without specific hero sections (Our Service, Our Feed, Contact, Work). Smooth transitions (0.3s ease) provide polished user experience. Overlay open state maintains priority to ensure menu functionality works correctly.
Next steps: Test hamburger icon visibility on all pages across different screen sizes; verify smooth transitions when scrolling into/out of hero sections; test on mobile devices to ensure hero detection works correctly; verify hamburger icon appears on page load when hero is in view.

Topics: Hamburger icon fixed position - only visible in hero section, doesn't move on scroll
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Removed `transform: scale()` from `.nav-circle-btn.hero-out-of-view` and `.nav-circle-btn.hero-in-view` classes to ensure hamburger icon stays in fixed position without any visual movement. Hamburger icon now only changes opacity and visibility when hero section is in/out of view, maintaining its fixed position (position: fixed !important, top: 0.75rem, right: 1.25rem) at all times. Removed transform scale from overlay open state as well. Removed transform scale from `.nav-circle-btn:hover` to prevent any movement on hover. Updated transition property from `all 0.3s ease` to explicit properties (opacity, visibility, background, border-color) to prevent animating position or transform. Added comments clarifying that hamburger stays in fixed position like logo, only visibility changes. Mobile responsive rules also updated to ensure no transform on mobile devices. Hamburger icon behaves like logo - fixed position that doesn't move on scroll, only visibility changes based on hero section visibility.
Decisions: Hamburger icon maintains fixed position (doesn't move on scroll) and only visibility changes when scrolling into/out of hero section. No transform animations to prevent any visual movement or position changes. Smooth opacity and visibility transitions (0.3s ease) provide polished user experience. Fixed positioning maintained across all breakpoints with !important flags. Hamburger icon position matches logo behavior - completely static position with only visibility/opacity changes.
Next steps: Test hamburger icon stays fixed on scroll across all pages; verify it only appears when hero section is in view; test on mobile devices to ensure fixed positioning is maintained; verify smooth fade in/out transitions without any position movement.

Topics: Hamburger icon positioned like logo - sticky on top with header
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Changed hamburger icon from `position: fixed` to `position: relative` to match logo positioning behavior. Updated `.nav-actions .nav-circle-btn` from `position: fixed !important` with `top: 0.75rem, right: 1.25rem` to `position: relative !important` (removed top/right positioning). Updated base `.nav-circle-btn` class from `position: fixed` to `position: relative`. Updated all mobile breakpoints (max-width: 991px, 768px, 480px) to use `position: relative` instead of `position: fixed`, removing all `top` and `right` positioning values. Hamburger icon now positioned like logo - moves with header instead of being fixed to viewport. Updated comments to reflect "positioned like logo - sticky on top with header" behavior.
Decisions: Hamburger icon now behaves exactly like logo - positioned relative to header and moves with it. On desktop, header is `position: absolute` so hamburger moves with header. On mobile, header is `position: fixed` so hamburger sticks with header at top. Hamburger icon only displays when hero section is in view, maintaining visibility-based behavior while positioning matches logo. No transform animations, only opacity and visibility transitions.
Next steps: Test hamburger icon moves with header like logo across all pages; verify it sticks on top with header on mobile; test hero visibility detection still works correctly; verify smooth fade in/out when scrolling into/out of hero sections.

Topics: Our Service page cards redesign - dark white background with modern layered aesthetic
Code changes:
- In `src/pages/OurService.jsx`: Updated service carousel cards with comprehensive redesign for contemporary creative studio vibe. Changed card background from dark colors (`#111` on desktop, `#808080` on mobile) to dark white (`#f5f5f5`) for modern, clean aesthetic. Enhanced drop shadows with layered multi-shadow approach (4px, 10px, 20px, 30px depth layers) using rgba(0,0,0,0.08-0.15) for sophisticated depth and modular feel. Updated typography for high contrast: changed text colors from white to dark (`#1a1a1a` for keywords, `#4a4a4a` for copyright), improved font weights (700 for keywords, 500 for copyright), enhanced letter spacing (1.2px for keywords, 0.4px for copyright), added system font stack (`system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`), added subtle text shadows for clarity on images. Updated VLogo component fill from white to `#1a1a1a` for visibility on light background. Adjusted image styling: changed filter from `brightness(0.85)` to `brightness(1.02) saturate(1.05)` for enhanced visuals on light background, updated overlay gradient from dark (rgba(0,0,0,0.15-0.3)) to subtle light gradient (rgba(255,255,255,0.03) to rgba(0,0,0,0.06)) maintaining image clarity. Added radial gradient backdrop for VLogo visibility on varied images. Improved spacing: increased bottom padding from 18px to 24px, left/right padding from 26/22px to 32/28px, increased gap between keywords from 2px to 4px. Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to overlay, `display: 'block'` to keyword spans, responsive font sizing for mobile breakpoints.
Decisions: Dark white background (#f5f5f5) provides modern, clean foundation for creative studio aesthetic. Layered drop shadows create depth and modular, engaging design with contemporary feel. High-contrast dark text on light background ensures excellent readability and visual hierarchy. Clean typography with system fonts and refined spacing creates professional, modern look. Subtle image enhancements and overlays maintain image quality while working with light background. Overall design achieves high-contrast visuals, clean typography, clear section hierarchy, and modern layered aesthetic with drop shadows for depth as requested.
Next steps: Verify service cards render correctly across all breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile); test 3D carousel rotation with new light background; confirm text readability on all images; verify drop shadows provide appropriate depth without being too heavy; test on various browsers for consistency.

Topics: Project showcase pendulum stack animation
Code changes: Rebuilt `src/components/ProjectSection.jsx` to move six project cards through a five-slot queue so one card stays just off-screen and swings in from alternating sides. Added slot presets, swing timers, and per-card delay variables to create the requested pendulum-style hits. Updated `src/styles/projectShowcase.css` with the new stacked layout (narrower stage width, deeper shadows, scale-aware transforms, sequential transition delays, and refreshed image wrapper styling).
Decisions: Keep the project data array as-is but let JS control positions dynamically for responsiveness. Let the pendulum loop automatically with CSS delays providing the one-by-one impact feel; no manual controls for now.
Next steps: Manually verify the new animation timing and overlaps across desktop and small breakpoints; tweak slot presets if any card clips the viewport edges.

Code changes: In `src/styles/main.css`, added breakpoint-specific `margin-top`/`margin-right` offsets for `.nav-circle-btn` at max-width 768px, 576px, and 420px so the hamburger button sits slightly higher and closer to the screen edge on phones while leaving desktop/tablet placement untouched.
Decisions: Keep the button positioned relative to the header (no transforms) and rely on negative margins for subtle positional tweaks that respect the existing “moves with the logo” requirement.
Next steps: Verify the new offsets on common mobile widths (768, 576, 420) to ensure the button remains fully visible and doesn’t collide with other header elements.

Topics: Mobile hamburger additional lift
Code changes: Increased the negative `margin-top`/`margin-right` adjustments for `.nav-circle-btn` inside the <=768px, <=576px, and <=420px media queries in `src/styles/main.css` so the hamburger icon rides even higher and slightly more to the right on smaller screens while keeping desktop/tablet unaffected.
Decisions: Maintain relative positioning tied to the header; use progressively larger offsets on narrower breakpoints for consistent visual spacing near the viewport edge.
Next steps: Spot-check header alignment on 768px, 576px, and 420px widths to confirm the icon remains fully visible and doesn’t overlap adjacent UI elements.

Topics: Mobile hamburger pure vertical lift
Code changes: Adjusted `src/styles/main.css` so `.nav-circle-btn` uses stronger negative `margin-top` values (−18px, −22px, −24px across the ≤768px/≤576px/≤420px breakpoints) while resetting `margin-right` to 0, keeping the icon centered horizontally but moved higher on mobile.
Decisions: Preserve the “moves with the header” requirement and remove horizontal nudges so only the requested upward shift remains.
Next steps: Recheck the header on common phone widths to ensure the higher position doesn’t collide with the top edge or other elements.

Date: 2025-11-24
Time: 16:43:24
Topics: Mobile hamburger further lift
Code changes: In `src/styles/main.css`, increased the negative `margin-top` for `.nav-circle-btn` to −24px (≤768px), −28px (≤576px), and −32px (≤420px) so the icon sits even closer to the top edge on smaller screens while keeping horizontal alignment unchanged.
Decisions: Continue using relative positioning with zero right margin to keep the button aligned with the header while satisfying the stronger upward offset request.
Next steps: Verify on devices around 768px/576px/420px to confirm the icon stays visible and doesn’t overlap the viewport edge or header content.

Date: 2025-11-24
Time: 16:44:43
Topics: Mobile hamburger extreme lift
Code changes: Updated `src/styles/main.css` once more so `.nav-circle-btn` now uses `margin-top` values of −30px (≤768px), −34px (≤576px), and −38px (≤420px), keeping `margin-right: 0` while pushing the icon even closer to the top edge on mobile screens.
Decisions: Maintain the same relative positioning strategy; continue scaling the offset with smaller breakpoints for consistency.
Next steps: Re-test on representative mobile widths to ensure the icon doesn’t clip against the viewport edge or overlap header content.

Date: 2025-11-24
Time: 16:46:12
Topics: Mobile hamburger ultra lift
Code changes: Further increased the negative `margin-top` values for `.nav-circle-btn` in `src/styles/main.css` to −36px (≤768px), −40px (≤576px), and −44px (≤420px), leaving `margin-right: 0` so the icon continues moving straight upward on smaller screens.
Decisions: Keep scales consistent per breakpoint and maintain relative positioning to avoid layout shifts elsewhere.
Next steps: Validate on phones/tablets to be sure the icon still renders fully without clipping at the very top edge.

Date: 2025-11-24
Time: 16:49:26
Topics: Mobile header logo downward offset
Code changes: Added positive `margin-top` values for `.logo-image` within the ≤768px, ≤576px, ≤420px, ≤374px, and 375–479px media queries in `src/styles/main.css` so the header logo sits slightly lower on mobile; tweaks scale from +6px down to +10px depending on breakpoint.
Decisions: Keep desktop/tablet untouched and use simple margin offsets to avoid structural layout changes.
Next steps: Spot-check the header on common phone widths (768/576/420/375) to ensure the new spacing feels balanced and doesn’t crowd the nav circle button.

Topics: Mobile hamburger visibility
Code changes: Updated `src/components/Header.jsx` so `checkHeroInView` immediately returns true on viewports ≤768px, ensuring the hamburger button remains visible across all pages once the site is viewed on mobile, regardless of hero visibility.
Decisions: Leave tablet/desktop behavior unchanged; only short-circuit the hero check for small screens to keep the icon accessible.
Next steps: Verify on actual devices that the hamburger now stays visible after scrolling past the hero on mobile routes.

Topics: Hide header on mobile when FlowAnimation/footer is visible
Code changes: In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, extended the FlowAnimation visibility effect to track viewport width, continue hiding `MinimalistNav`, and toggle a `body.hide-header-in-flow` class whenever the footer enters view on ≤768px screens (also cleans up on resize/unmount). Added a mobile-only CSS rule in `src/styles/main.css` so `.header` fades out and becomes non-interactive while that class is present.
Decisions: Keep the nav hiding behavior for all breakpoints; scope header suppression to mobile to match the request while leaving desktop header unchanged.
Next steps: Verify on devices/emulators that both the header and MinimalistNav reappear immediately after scrolling above the FlowAnimation section; adjust thresholds if further tuning is needed.

Date: 2025-11-24
Time: N/A (timestamp command unavailable)
Topics: Global FlowAnimation visibility handling across navigation pages
Code changes: Updated `src/components/FlowAnimation.jsx` to observe its viewport visibility, dispatch a `flowAnimationVisibility` custom event, and toggle the `body.hide-header-in-flow` class automatically on mobile. `MinimalistNav.jsx` now listens for this event to add a `flow-hidden` state so the nav hides on any page when the footer is in view, eliminating the Home-specific show/hide state. `src/pages/Home.jsx` now always renders `MinimalistNav` and relies on the shared event, and `src/styles/main.css` gained `.minimalist-nav.flow-hidden` styling to fade the nav out cleanly.
Decisions: Centralize FlowAnimation detection so every page with the footer automatically hides both header (mobile) and MinimalistNav, reducing duplicated scroll logic.
Next steps: Smoke test Work/Team/Contact/Feed pages in mobile view to confirm both the header and bottom nav disappear while the FlowAnimation section is on screen and return immediately afterward.

Topics: Our Team board slider text visibility on mobile
Code changes: Set the inline `opacity` of the `.board-members-slider` in `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx` based on `isSectionInView`, overriding the mobile breakpoint default that kept the slider at 0 opacity. Once the Board section enters the viewport, the slider (images + text) now fades in on phones just like desktop.
Decisions: Keep the CSS fade-in behavior but control visibility from React so content is never stuck invisible when the section is in view.
Next steps: Scroll through the Board of Directors section on a phone/emulator to confirm both portraits and their text appear as soon as the section intersects the viewport.

Date: 2025-11-24
Time: N/A (timestamp command unavailable)
Topics: Mobile-responsive Board of Directors animation enhancements
Code changes: Updated `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx` so the slider width on mobile matches the viewport, added per-card animation styles via `getMobileCardStyle`, and set the slider’s inline layout (padding/align) when `isMobile` is true. In `src/styles/main.css`, the board container now hides overflow while the ≤768px/≤480px breakpoints give the slider full width, remove gaps, and let each card occupy 100% width with smoother transitions.
Decisions: Preserve the existing scroll-driven timeline but layer on mobile-friendly animations and layout logic so portraits/text stay fully visible while still animating card-by-card.
Next steps: Review the Board section on devices/emulators to confirm each card fills the screen, animates smoothly, and that desktop layout remains unaffected.

Topics: Hide Board slider scrollbars on mobile
Code changes: Within the ≤768px/≤480px breakpoints of `src/styles/main.css`, set `.board-members-slider` to hide overflow and applied cross-browser scrollbar suppression (`scrollbar-width: none`, `-ms-overflow-style: none`, `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }`) so the right/bottom scrollbars no longer appear on phones.
Decisions: Keep the slider scrollable via JS but remove the visual scrollbars for a cleaner mobile presentation.
Next steps: Spot-check the Board section on iOS/Android browsers to ensure the scrollbars are gone while the animation still operates normally.

Topics: Board mobile card centering (2nd–5th images)
Code changes: In `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx`, added `sliderDisplayIndex` that rounds `scrollProgress` on mobile, uses it for `translateX`, and feeds it into `getMobileCardStyle()` so each portrait snaps into a centered, full-opacity state after the first card.
Decisions: Keep the scroll timeline intact but discretize mobile steps so all cards get the same focused view.
Next steps: Scroll the Board section on phones to confirm each of the later cards now appears as clearly as the first; adjust the rounding logic if needed.

Topics: Board slider percentage translation on mobile
Code changes: Switched the mobile slider transform in `src/pages/OurTeam.jsx` from pixel-based widths to percentage steps (`translateX(-index * 100%)`) with a smooth transition, ensuring each full-width card aligns perfectly in view regardless of device width.
Decisions: Keep desktop translation tied to measured pixel widths while letting mobile rely on percentage-based snapping for consistent framing.
Next steps: Recheck the Board section on a range of phone widths to confirm every card now fills the viewport without partial clipping.

Topics: Hide MinimalistNav on mobile across all pages
Code changes: In `src/styles/main.css`, added a `@media (max-width: 768px)` rule that sets `.minimalist-nav` to `display: none !important`, removing the bottom mini navigation bar on phones/tablets while leaving desktop/tablet behavior unchanged.
Decisions: Use a CSS-only approach to keep existing JS scroll/visibility logic intact but visually suppress the mini nav on mobile as requested.
Next steps: Verify on mobile devices/emulators that the MinimalistNav no longer appears on any route, and that desktop layouts remain unaffected.

Topics: Our Team hero mobile layout fix
Code changes: Adjusted `src/styles/main.css` so `.team-hero` on ≤768px uses `height: auto` with `min-height: calc(100vh - 72px)` and top padding to clear the header, and aligned `.team-hero-overlay` to the bottom. Simplified the small-screen hero padding to keep the "We are Vulture Lines." title fully visible and comfortably placed on mobile.
Decisions: Keep the full-screen feel while preventing the header from overlapping or cropping the hero content on phones.
Next steps: Check the Our Team hero on several mobile widths to ensure the background image fills the viewport and the heading sits clearly above the fold.

Topics: Mobile responsive home page services section redesign - content first, then image with carousel navigation
Code changes: 
- In `src/pages/Home.jsx`: Added `mobileServiceIndex` state for carousel navigation. Created separate mobile layout structure that displays: "Our Services" heading → service title → description → "Find More" button with left/right arrow buttons → image carousel. Added `handleMobileServicePrev` and `handleMobileServiceNext` functions for arrow navigation. Mobile layout conditionally renders when `isServicesMobile` is true (≤768px breakpoint). Updated mobile detection from 1024px to 768px to match CSS breakpoint. Mobile image carousel uses `translateX` transform with smooth transitions to slide between services.
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Added comprehensive mobile-specific styles for services section including `.services-mobile-content`, `.services-mobile-image-container`, `.services-mobile-image-track`, `.service-mobile-image-item` for proper layout ordering (content first, image second). Added `.service-mobile-actions` flex container for button and arrows. Styled `.service-arrow-btn` with circular design, hover effects, and proper touch targets (44px on mobile, 40px on small mobile). Added responsive styles for ≤480px breakpoint with adjusted padding and arrow button sizes. Mobile layout uses flexbox ordering to ensure content appears before image.
Decisions: Mobile-first approach with carousel navigation provides better UX on mobile devices. Content-first layout ensures users see service information before images. Arrow buttons positioned next to "Find More" button for easy navigation. Smooth sliding transitions create polished carousel experience. Desktop layout remains unchanged with scroll-based elevator animation.
Next steps: Test mobile services section on actual devices; verify arrow navigation works smoothly; check image carousel sliding animation; verify layout order (heading → title → content → button/arrows → image) on various mobile screen sizes.

Topics: Mobile services section scroll fix and spacing reduction
Code changes: 
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Fixed mobile services section to prevent unwanted scroll by setting `height: auto !important`, `min-height: auto !important`, and `overflow: visible` on mobile breakpoint (≤768px). Disabled scroll animation classes on mobile (`.services-section.is-fixed` set to `position: relative !important`). Reduced mobile services section padding from `2rem 0` to `1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0` (reduced bottom padding). Reduced mobile content padding from `2rem 1.5rem` to `1.5rem 1.5rem 1rem 1.5rem` (reduced bottom padding). Added `margin-top: 0 !important` and `padding-top: 0 !important` to `.client-experience-section` on mobile to eliminate gap between services and client experience sections. Ensured services container is always visible on mobile with `opacity: 1 !important`, `pointer-events: auto !important`, and `visibility: visible !important`.
Decisions: Mobile services section now uses static carousel navigation instead of scroll-based animation to prevent unwanted scrolling. Reduced spacing creates tighter flow between services and client experience sections. No scroll animation on mobile provides better UX with arrow-based navigation.
Next steps: Test on mobile devices to verify no unwanted scrolling; check spacing between sections looks balanced; verify carousel navigation works smoothly without scroll interference.

Topics: Mobile excellence section scroll fix and spacing reduction
Code changes:
- In `src/pages/Home.jsx`: Disabled excellence section pinning animation on mobile (≤768px) by checking `window.innerWidth` in `handleExcellencePin` and returning early with `isExcellencePinned` and `isExcellencePast` set to false. Disabled excellence scroll-based size increase animation on mobile by checking `window.innerWidth <= 768` in `handleExcellenceScroll` and returning early with `progress` set to 0. Added resize event listener to excellence scroll handler for proper mobile detection.
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Fixed excellence wrapper height on mobile by setting `height: auto !important` and `min-height: auto !important` to prevent unwanted scroll from `200vh` desktop height. Disabled excellence section pinning on mobile by forcing `.excellence-section.is-pinned` to `position: relative !important` with auto positioning. Disabled excellence section past state on mobile by forcing `.excellence-section.is-past` to `position: relative !important`. Reduced excellence section padding from `1.5rem 0` to `1.5rem 0 0.25rem 0` (reduced bottom padding). Added `margin-bottom: 0 !important` and `padding-bottom: 0 !important` to excellence wrapper and section on mobile. Reduced services section top padding from `1.5rem 0` to `0.5rem 0` on mobile to minimize gap between excellence and services sections. Added `margin-top: 0 !important` to services section on mobile.
Decisions: Excellence section now uses static layout on mobile instead of scroll-based pinning animation to prevent unwanted scrolling. Reduced spacing creates tighter flow between excellence and services sections. No scroll animations on mobile provide better UX with natural scrolling behavior.
Next steps: Test on mobile devices to verify no unwanted scrolling in excellence section; check spacing between excellence and services sections looks balanced; verify natural scroll behavior works smoothly without animation interference.

Topics: Remove excellence section content disappear animation on scroll
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Removed all initial `opacity: 0` states from excellence section elements that caused content to disappear. Changed `.excellence-title span` from `opacity: 0` and `transform: translateX(-50px)` to `opacity: 1` and `transform: translateX(0)` so title is always visible. Changed `.excellence-subtitle` from `opacity: 0` and `transform: translateY(30px)` to `opacity: 1` and `transform: translateY(0)` so subtitle is always visible. Changed `.excellence-description` from `opacity: 0` and `transform: translateY(30px)` to `opacity: 1` and `transform: translateY(0)` so description is always visible. Changed `.excellence-buttons` from `opacity: 0` and `transform: translateY(30px)` to `opacity: 1` and `transform: translateY(0)` so buttons are always visible. Changed `.emblem-number` from `opacity: 0` and `transform: scale(0.5) translateX(40px)` to `opacity: 1` and `transform: scale(1) translateX(40px)` so number is always visible. Changed `.emblem-text` from `opacity: 0` and `transform: translateY(20px) translateX(40px)` to `opacity: 1` and `transform: translateY(0) translateX(40px)` so text is always visible. Changed `.rotating-group` from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1` so circular text is always visible.
Decisions: All excellence section content now remains visible at all times without disappearing animations. Content appears immediately without waiting for scroll-triggered animations. Removed fade-in animations that caused content to disappear during scroll.
Next steps: Test excellence section to verify all content remains visible during scroll; verify no content disappears when scrolling through the section; check that all elements (title, subtitle, description, buttons, emblem) are always visible.

Topics: Mobile responsive section order - Client Experience before Projects
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Ensured Client Experience section appears before Projects section on mobile by maintaining natural HTML order (no flexbox reordering). Added `margin-bottom: 0 !important` and `padding-bottom: 0.5rem !important` to `.client-experience-section` on mobile for proper spacing. Added `margin-top: 0 !important` and `padding-top: 0.5rem !important` to `#projects` section on mobile to create minimal gap between Client Experience and Projects sections. Removed any flexbox ordering rules that would reorder sections on mobile.
Decisions: Mobile section order now matches desktop order: Services → Client Experience → Projects. Natural HTML order is maintained without CSS flexbox reordering. Minimal spacing (0.5rem) between Client Experience and Projects sections provides clean flow.
Next steps: Test on mobile devices to verify Client Experience appears before Projects; verify section order matches desktop layout; check spacing between sections looks balanced.

Topics: Client Experience logos hidden by Projects on mobile
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Restored the mobile stacking context so Client Experience images/logos sit above Projects. Reapplied `min-height: 100vh !important`, extra bottom padding, `position: relative`, `z-index: 2`, and `overflow: visible` to `.client-experience-section` plus the nested containers (`.client-experience-split`, `.client-experience-left`, `.client-experience-right`, `.laptop-image-container`, `.client-logos-grid`, `.client-logo`, `.client-overlay`). Added a 2rem top padding and lower z-index to `#projects` so it only begins after the Client Experience content finishes. Set `.client-experience-right` to minimum 320px height (50vh) so the laptop image has room on small screens.
Decisions: Client Experience section now fully displays before Projects on phones, preventing logos/images from being clipped or overlapped. Users see the entire client block before Projects enters the viewport.
Next steps: Re-test at 768px and 480px widths to ensure the spacing feels natural and no overlap reappears.

Topics: Our Projects heading overlapped by Client Experience imagery on mobile
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Increased the spacing between the Client Experience and Projects sections on mobile by bumping `.client-experience-section` bottom padding/margin to `3rem` and raising `#projects` top padding to `3rem`. This ensures the “OUR PROJECTS” heading appears after a clear gap so the remaining Client Experience logos no longer sit on top of it.
Decisions: Creating a larger handoff buffer between the two sections prevents visual overlap without changing the scroll order or z-index behavior.
Next steps: Verify on devices/emulators (≤768px) that the heading now renders with clear whitespace and no client logos covering it; adjust spacing further if additional breathing room is desired.

Topics: Client Experience z-index cleanup so Our Projects title renders above imagery
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Removed the elevated z-indices from the Client Experience stack and instead raised the `#projects` z-index to 3 (with a white background). `.client-experience-section` and its nested containers now rely on the natural DOM stacking order, preventing their logos/laptop image from overlaying the “OUR PROJECTS” title as it enters the viewport.
Decisions: Restoring default stacking order ensures the Projects heading always sits on top while still letting Client Experience content display fully within its own section.
Next steps: Recheck on small devices to confirm the heading is no longer obscured and that no additional z-index adjustments are required.

Topics: Responsive spacing between Client Experience and Projects sections
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Replaced the fixed 3rem buffer with responsive `clamp` values so the gap scales with viewport height. `.client-experience-section` now ends with `margin-bottom: clamp(3rem, 12vh, 6rem)` and `padding-bottom: clamp(2.5rem, 10vh, 5rem)`, while `#projects` begins with `padding-top: clamp(3rem, 12vh, 6rem)`. This guarantees taller devices get a larger handoff while smaller phones keep a compact spacing.
Decisions: Dynamic spacing ensures the “OUR PROJECTS” heading always appears below the Client Experience block without overlap across various screen heights.
Next steps: Spot-check at 768px, 600px, and 480px widths to confirm the gap looks natural; tweak clamp ranges if more/less space is desired.

Topics: Increase Client Experience → Projects gap further for tall displays
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Expanded the responsive gap by using `clamp(4rem, 16vh, 8rem)` for the Client Experience bottom margin and Projects top padding (with slightly larger padding-bottom on Client Experience). Added an explicit white background to both sections to guarantee a clean transition even if underlying imagery extends beyond its container.
Decisions: Larger, height-aware spacing plus matching backgrounds ensures the Projects heading can never be covered by lingering client images on taller devices.
Next steps: Re-test on very tall phones/tablets (e.g., 896px+ viewport height) to verify the separation feels balanced; adjust clamp maximums if additional space is still required.

Topics: Final buffer + heading z-index for Our Projects
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Increased the Client Experience bottom margin/padding to `clamp(5rem, 18vh, 10rem)`/`clamp(3.5rem, 14vh, 6.5rem)` and matched `#projects` top padding (`clamp(5rem, 18vh, 10rem)`). Also forced the projects header elements to `position: relative; z-index: 4` so the “OUR PROJECTS” title always renders above any lingering imagery.
Decisions: Combining a larger responsive gap with an explicit z-index on the heading guarantees no overlap across tall or short devices.
Next steps: Confirm on multiple breakpoints that the heading remains clear; tweak clamp values if a smaller/larger gap is preferred.

Topics: Client Experience mobile layout cleanup
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Redesigned the ≤768px Client Experience layout—removed forced 100vh sizing, added a padded/rounded container, stacked the split content vertically with larger gaps, refreshed the logo grid cards, and reworked the laptop image block so it uses a dedicated gradient card with proper padding. The section now reads as logos grid → showcase image with centered caption, each with breathing room.
Decisions: The mobile view no longer looks like a squashed desktop split; it now feels like a purpose-built block with clear hierarchy and spacing.
Next steps: Review across common phone widths to confirm the new spacing feels balanced; tweak card sizes if needed.

Topics: Client Experience mobile polish (logo cards + hero image)
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Fine-tuned the ≤768px Client Experience styles with centered heading text, card shadows, a fixed aspect-ratio hero image, and a tighter caption overlay so the showcase block no longer overlaps the logo grid. The section now stacks cleanly with consistent spacing before the Projects area.
Decisions: The refreshed styling makes the mobile Client Experience feel deliberate and prevents the hero image from intruding on the logos.
Next steps: Verify on small phones (≤420px) that the card grid and hero block still have enough breathing room; tweak gaps if needed.

Topics: Client Experience vs Projects overlap fix
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Raised the Client Experience section z-index, expanded its bottom margin, lowered `#projects` stacking context, removed the dark overlay from the hero caption, and ensured the logos grid uses a proper grid layout. These tweaks stop the projects card from overlaying the client block while keeping the heading readable.
Decisions: Separation between the two sections is now purely structural (spacing + stacking), eliminating the double overlay seen on phones.
Next steps: Recheck at 768px/600px/480px to confirm there’s no remaining overlap; adjust spacing if additional breathing room is desired.

Topics: Client Experience mobile layout – logos then image
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Centered the heading block, limited the logos grid width, added auto margins, and ensured the showcase image uses a fixed aspect ratio with the caption placed below it. Tapping a logo now simply swaps the image in the reserved area without any overlap because the image card sits in its own column under the grid.
Decisions: The mobile Client Experience section now reads sequentially (heading → logos → selected image). There’s no longer a double overlay, and the image always displays fully beneath the icons.
Next steps: Verify interaction on devices to confirm the image swaps smoothly; fine-tune card spacing if desired.

Topics: Client Experience image spacing on mobile
Code changes:
- In `src/styles/main.css`: Increased the logo grid’s bottom margin and the showcase block’s top margin so the selected client image sits farther below the last icon (margin-bottom `clamp(2rem, 6vw, 3rem)` on the grid and margin-top `clamp(2.5rem, 7vw, 3.5rem)` on `.client-experience-right`).
Decisions: Extra spacing prevents the hero image from hiding the final row of logos on phones.
Next steps: Review on target devices; tweak margins if you’d like even more separation.

Decisions: The increased buffer guarantees the image never overlaps the final logo, even on short devices.
Next steps: Spot-check on 375px/414px widths; adjust the clamps if more/less space is desired.

- In `src/styles/main.css`: Raised the logos grid bottom margin to `clamp(3.5rem, 10vw, 5rem)` and the image block top margin to `clamp(4.5rem, 11vw, 5.5rem)` so there’s a very clear gap between the last icon and the hero image on small screens.
Decisions: This ensures the image never hides the final card, even on the shortest viewports.
Next steps: Re-test on target devices; if it now feels too wide, we can dial the clamps back.

Code changes: Deleted the inline `VLogo` SVG component and its conditional overlay block inside `src/pages/OurService.jsx`, leaving the rotating cards as pure imagery without additional graphics.
Decisions: Maintain the same image/overlay styling while removing the brand mark entirely per request.
Next steps: Review the carousel on desktop and mobile to ensure removal doesn’t affect card spacing or lighting.

Topics: Mobile services arrows visibility
Code changes: Updated `.service-mobile-actions`, `.service-nav-arrows`, and `.service-arrow-btn` styles in `src/styles/main.css` to force fixed circular sizing (with `!important` padding resets), add contrasty white backgrounds, borders, and shadows, and tweak the small-mobile overrides so the arrow buttons sit above content and stay visible against any backdrop.
Decisions: Keep HTML untouched while ensuring the arrows remain legible and tappable across all mobile breakpoints by resolving conflicting global button rules.
Next steps: Smoke-test the Home page on ≤768px viewports to confirm the arrows now display as white circles with green icons and continue to advance the services carousel.

Topics: Custom cursor dot circle size reduction
Code changes: In `src/styles/main.css`, reduced `.custom-cursor` size from 20px to 16px (width and height). In `src/components/CustomCursor.jsx`, adjusted positioning offset from 10px to 8px to keep cursor centered (half of new 16px size).
Decisions: Slightly smaller cursor provides more subtle visual presence while maintaining visibility and functionality. Positioning offset adjusted proportionally to maintain proper centering.
Next steps: Verify cursor appears correctly centered on mouse position; test hover states and client section cursor behavior.
